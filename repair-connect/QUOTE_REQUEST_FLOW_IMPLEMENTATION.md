# Quote Request Flow - Complete Implementation Summary

## üéØ Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the fixed Quote Request UX flow, addressing critical bugs where state was lost on navigation, quote request buttons restarted the entire flow, and there was no visual feedback for sent quotes.

---

## üêõ Root Causes Diagnosed

### 1. **State Loss on Navigation** (src/app/(customer)/quotations/workshops/page.tsx:74-113)
- The page read `carId` from URL query params but lost it when users navigated away
- Browser back/forward didn't preserve selected car context
- Used `sessionStorage` for workshop selections but not for car selection

### 2. **Request Quote Actions Restart Flow** (components/workshops/workshop-card.tsx:152-154, 284-286)
- Both card and profile "Request Quote" buttons redirected to `/quotations/request?workshopId=...`
- Discarded any selected car context and forced users to restart
- No way to send a quote request directly for a specific workshop when car was already selected

### 3. **No "Quote Sent" Tracking**
- No visual feedback showing which workshops had already received quote requests
- Users couldn't tell if they'd already requested a quote from a workshop
- No persistent state for sent quotes per user/car/workshop combination

---

## üí° Solution Approach

**Selected: Zustand + localStorage + Server Sync (Recommended)**

### Why This Approach?
- Centralized state management with minimal boilerplate
- localStorage persistence survives page reloads
- Tab-sync via `storage` events
- Supports optimistic UI with server reconciliation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Tracks sent quotes per user/car/workshop
- Better UX with instant feedback

### Badge Semantics Decision
**Implemented:** **Per (userId, workshopId, carId)**

**Justification:** Users often own multiple cars and may want to request quotes for different vehicles from the same workshop. The badge indicates "I've already sent a quote request *for this specific car* to this workshop."

---

## üì¶ Implementation Details

### 1. **Zustand Store** (`src/stores/quoteRequestStore.ts`)

```typescript
interface QuoteRequestState {
  selectedCar: Car | null;
  sentQuotes: Record<string, SentQuote>; // Key: `${carId}_${workshopId}`
  sendingQuotes: Set<string>; // Transient state for optimistic UI

  // Actions
  setSelectedCar(car: Car | null): void;
  markQuoteSending(carId: string, workshopId: string): void;
  markQuoteSent(quote: SentQuote): void;
  markQuoteFailed(carId: string, workshopId: string): void;
  hasQuoteSent(carId?: string, workshopId?: string): boolean;
  syncFromServer(serverQuotes: SentQuote[]): void;
}
```

**Features:**
- Persists `selectedCar` and `sentQuotes` to localStorage
- Does NOT persist `sendingQuotes` (transient optimistic state)
- Supports bulk operations for "Select All" functionality
- Server reconciliation via `syncFromServer()`

### 2. **Tab Sync Hook** (`src/hooks/useQuoteRequestSync.ts`)

```typescript
export function useQuoteRequestSync(options?: {
  syncWithServer?: boolean;
  userId?: string;
})
```

**Features:**
- Listens to `storage` events for cross-tab sync
- Optional server sync on mount
- Includes commented WebSocket/SSE examples for real-time sync

### 3. **Car Selection Hook** (`src/hooks/useRequireCarSelection.tsx`)

```typescript
export function useRequireCarSelection() {
  return {
    requireCar: (callback: (car: Car) => void | Promise<void>) => Promise<void>;
    isModalOpen: boolean;
    userCars: Car[];
    handleCarSelect: (car: Car) => void;
    // ...
  };
}
```

**Features:**
- Ensures car is selected before executing action
- Opens inline modal if no car is selected
- Executes callback automatically after selection
- Includes React Context alternative (commented)

### 4. **Quote Request Helpers** (`src/lib/quoteRequestHelpers.ts`)

```typescript
export async function sendSingleQuoteRequestDebounced(
  workshopId: string,
  workshopName: string,
  car: Car,
  options?: {...}
): Promise<string | null>

export async function sendBulkQuoteRequests(
  workshopIds: string[],
  workshopNames: Record<string, string>,
  car: Car,
  options?: {...}
): Promise<{ success: number; failed: number }>
```

**Features:**
- Optimistic UI: Marks as sending immediately
- Server validation and reconciliation
- Rollback on error with retry toast
- Debounce/duplicate prevention via in-flight request tracking
- Idempotency-Key header support
- Separate bulk function for "Select All" (unchanged behavior)

### 5. **Updated Components**

#### WorkshopCard (`components/workshops/workshop-card.tsx`)
- Added quote badge display (both list and grid views)
- Updated "Request Quote" button to use `handleRequestQuote` instead of redirect
- Shows loading state during request
- Disables button when quote is sent or sending
- Renders inline car selection modal when needed

#### Workshop Profile Page (`src/app/(customer)/workshops/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added quote status display in header
- Updated "Request Quote" button with same logic as cards
- Badge syncs with workshop card badges
- Inline car selection modal

#### Workshops Page (`src/app/(customer)/quotations/workshops/page.tsx`)
- Uses Zustand store for `selectedCar` (replaces local state)
- URL hydration: Validates `carId` from URL on mount
- Adds `carId` to URL if missing but present in store (deep-linking)
- Clears invalid `carId` and redirects to request page
- "Change Car" button to clear selection and restart
- **Unchanged:** "Select All + Send Quote Requests" bulk functionality

### 6. **API Endpoints**

#### `POST /api/quotations` (Updated)
- Added idempotency key support
- Checks for duplicate requests using `Idempotency-Key` header
- Returns existing quotation if duplicate detected

#### `GET /api/users/[id]/sent-quotes` (New)
- Fetches all quote requests sent by the user
- Supports filtering by `carId`
- Returns data in `SentQuote` format for store sync

- Syncs across tabs

### Button States
```
[Default]       ‚Üí "Request Quote"
[Sending]       ‚Üí "Sending..." (spinner, disabled)
[Sent]          ‚Üí "Quote Sent" (check icon, disabled)

## üîí Security & Performance

### Idempotency
- Uses `Idempotency-Key` header to prevent duplicate quote submissions
- Server validates and returns existing quotation if duplicate detected

### Rate Limiting
- In-flight request tracking prevents rapid duplicate clicks
- Per-workshop debounce via `sendSingleQuoteRequestDebounced`

### Data Validation
- Car ownership validated on backend (`/api/cars/[id]`)
- Invalid carId in URL triggers validation error and redirect
- Server validates all quote request data

### Performance
- Optimistic UI reduces perceived latency
- localStorage persistence eliminates unnecessary API calls
- Tab sync uses native `storage` events (no polling)
- Optional WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates (commented code provided)

---

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
**None.** All existing functionality is preserved.

### Backwards Compatibility
- "Select All + Send Quote Requests" flow unchanged
- Existing API endpoints remain compatible
- No database migrations required
- Works with existing car and workshop data structures

### Opt-in Features
- Server sync is optional (enable via `useQuoteRequestSync`)
- WebSocket/SSE real-time sync (commented examples provided)

---

## üìö Architecture Decisions

### Why Zustand over Context?
- Less boilerplate
- Built-in persistence middleware
- Better performance (selective subscriptions)
- Smaller bundle size (~3KB)
- Easier to test

### Why localStorage over sessionStorage?
- Survives tab close/reopen
- Enables tab sync
- Better UX for users who leave and return
- Can be cleared manually if needed

### Why Optimistic UI?
- Reduces perceived latency
- Better UX (instant feedback)
- Can rollback on error
- Industry standard (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)

### Why Per-Car Badge Semantics?
- Users often own multiple cars
- Different workshops may specialize in different car types
- Avoids confusion ("Did I already request for THIS car?")
- More granular tracking for analytics

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Server sync is optional** - Requires explicit opt-in via hook
2. **WebSocket/SSE not implemented** - Commented examples provided
3. **Badge doesn't show quote status** - Only shows "sent" vs "not sent"
4. **No retry queue** - Failed requests require manual retry

### Future Enhancements
1. Add quote status to badge (pending, accepted, rejected)
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Add retry queue with exponential backoff
4. Add analytics tracking for quote request metrics
5. Add "View Sent Quotes" page for users
